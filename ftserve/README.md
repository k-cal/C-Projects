# ftserve
A simple file transfer program that supports listing the current directory, changing directories, and sending files.

It's meant to be used in conjunction with the ftclient.py file, and the commands `-l`, `-g`, and `-cd`. See the included README for more detailed instructions. (The README meaning the text file, not this introduction.)

The files aren't uploaded yet, because the due date for this assignment hasn't passed yet.
