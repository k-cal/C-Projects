# ftserve
A simple file transfer program that supports listing the current directory, changing directories, and sending files.

It's meant to be used in conjunction with the ftclient.py file, and the commands `-l`, `-g`, and `-cd`. See the included README for more detailed instructions. (The README meaning the text file, not this introduction.)

It may seem unusual that the client is a Python script rather than being written in C, but the course required writing the two in different languages.
